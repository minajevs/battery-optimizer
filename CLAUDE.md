### Data Models
- `BatteryMode` enum: HOLD (0), CHARGE (1), DISCHARGE (2)
- `PricePoint` dataclass: Time (datetime) + price
- `ScheduleEntry` dataclass: Time (datetime) + mode + reason + direct-control fields (export_rate, ac_charge_mode, power_percent, SOC cutoffs)
- `LoadProfileStats` dataclass: Min/max/sum/count for load observations
- `LearningStats` dataclass: Charge rate learning data per SOC range

### Slot Resolution
- Default `slot_minutes=15` (96 slots/day) — matches Nord Pool 15-minute pricing periods
- Configurable via `apps.yaml` (`slot_minutes: 15`)
- Price service requests 15-min resolution from Nord Pool (`resolution` parameter)
- `_normalize_prices()` handles expansion if source data is coarser (e.g., hourly → 4x15min)
- Load profile supports migration from coarser buckets (30-min → 15-min) on first load
- A local day is not always 96 slots: Europe/Riga spring/autumn transitions produce 23/25-hour days. Internally, aware timestamps are keyed, sorted, and compared as UTC instants so the two autumn `03:00` intervals remain distinct; local time is for prediction and presentation.

## Core Algorithm

### Scheduling Logic (`DPOptimizer.optimize`)
Uses **dynamic programming** with SOC state tracking:
1. Discretize the configured SOC range using `soc_step_percent`
2. For each time slot, evaluate HOLD/CHARGE/DISCHARGE transitions
3. Track the best cumulative economic value for each reachable energy level
4. Backtrack to extract optimal action sequence

**Value calculations:**
- Marginal import price: `(spot_price + grid_fee) * import_price_multiplier`
- Net load: `max(0, predicted_load - predicted_pv)`; PV serves load before battery or grid energy
- Grid CHARGE cost uses AC imported energy. Stored battery energy includes the configured storage efficiency, while grid AC-to-DC conversion also applies `inverter_efficiency`; simultaneous PV surplus reduces the grid contribution.
- DISCHARGE serves `min(net_load, discharge_rate)` on the AC side. The SOC transition consumes additional DC energy for inverter loss, and battery wear is charged per discharged DC kWh.
- PV surplus can charge the battery in HOLD/CHARGE and remaining surplus earns `max(0, spot * export_rate_multiplier - grid_export_fee)`.

`efficiency` is the charge-retention factor, not a complete round-trip figure. `inverter_efficiency` applies on grid AC-to-DC charging and battery DC-to-AC discharge, so the modeled grid-charge round trip is approximately `efficiency * inverter_efficiency^2`.

**One slot-SOC model.** The expected-SOC trajectory, the SOC deviation detector
and the schedule log's fallback trajectory
(`ScheduleFormatter._format_expected_trajectory`) must all go through
`soc_projection.project_slot_soc` — never re-implement the transition locally.
The formatter was the third offender: its HOLD line ignored PV surplus charging
(`end_soc = start_soc`) and its DISCHARGE line drained `min(load, rate)` from
raw load without subtracting PV or dividing by `inverter_efficiency`, so a sunny
slot printed 50.0 %→48.6 % where the shared model gives 55.3 % — a contradiction
inside the very log used to diagnose SOC deviations. Its invariants (partial
first slot,
`pv >= load` during DISCHARGE/HOLD is PV *charging*, export slots use the export
discharge rate, DC-side energy moves the SOC, mid-slot anchoring) are documented
in `docs/scheduling-algorithm.md` § SOC transitions and discretization.
Divergence here caused a production recalculation loop, not a threshold problem.

**One thermal model.** Battery temperature is projected only by
`thermal_model.TemperatureProjector`, shared by the DP trajectory, the
expected-SOC trajectory (`soc_projection`), the schedule formatter and
`charge_rate_utils`. Two invariants must not be broken:

1. Warming is a function of `|P_bat|`, not of the mode — discharging heats the
   pack. Never reintroduce a `mode == CHARGE` branch in a temperature path;
   derive power with `thermal_model.battery_power_for_entry`.
2. Ambient is `T_ambient(t)` from `ambient_service`, never one scalar for the
   whole horizon. In the no-external-source fallback, the learning engine's
   rolling battery minimum anchors the diurnal profile's daily **maximum**, not
   its minimum: the pack is self-heated, so `T_bat >= T_ambient` always and
   `min(T_bat)` is a *ceiling* on ambient. Anchoring it as the trough and adding
   the amplitude put the profile peak at `min + 2A` — an "ambient" hotter than
   the battery, which made `TemperatureProjector` warm an idle pack (33.0 →
   34.6 C over 3 h at 0 kW) and made `record_cooling` reject every summer
   cooling sample as `temp_end < ambient`.

The temperature trajectory in `DPOptimizerResult` is reporting-only; temperature
changes DP decisions solely through `compute_charge_rates_per_slot`. Details,
the `k1`/`k2` units and the calibration/bootstrap rules are in
`docs/scheduling-algorithm.md` § Thermal model.

`min_charge_slots_required` is reporting-only: it estimates the aggregate energy deficit but does not constrain the DP. Feasibility comes from SOC-state transitions and power limits.

At the price-horizon boundary, `terminal_energy_value_eur_kwh` values usable stored DC energy. `auto` derives a conservative value from the median forecast import price, discharge conversion, and wear. It is a salvage value, not a hard terminal-SOC target.

`0` is **no-salvage mode**: it declares stored energy worthless at the horizon, so every plan ends by spending it (`EXPORT (until depleted) -> min_soc`). This is harmless while the daily re-optimization extends the horizon before those slots execute. Which mode is active is STATED, not warned about — once at config load (`config.TERMINAL_VALUE_ZERO_NOTICE`, also emitted from `log_summary`) and rate-limited from the DP (`DPOptimizer(warn_degenerate_terminal=...)`, gated by `_should_warn_degenerate_terminal()` to once per 6 h), all at INFO. Both settings have a real failure mode, so the code must not prescribe one: `0` risks spending the battery at the horizon edge, `"auto"` risks stranding charge there and skipping evening slots priced below the median. On the reference installation `"auto"` was tried and reverted: it stranded ~77% SOC at the horizon edge and skipped evening slots priced below the median, which cost more than the end-of-horizon spend it prevented. Do not re-add the old INFO line "net-load slots worth less than this are HELD" for the zero case — nothing is worth less than zero, so it described a rule that could never fire.

**The schedule log's value column is `ScheduleEntry.marginal_value_eur_kwh`, not the cost basis.** The DP fills it (with `value_basis` ∈ `avoided-import` / `export` / `landed-charge` / `kept`) from the same `_buy_price`/`_sell_price` arithmetic it scores slots with, normalized to one battery DC kWh. It is REPORTING ONLY — the DP objective never reads it, and `tests/test_schedule_value_column.py::test_marginal_value_does_not_change_the_schedule` guards that. Any new tariff formula must go through `_buy_price`/`_sell_price` so the report cannot drift from the objective.

### Inverter Control (DirectControl + ControlBackend)
`DirectControl` is **policy only** — it knows no register or service name. All
integration-specific knowledge lives behind a `ControlBackend`
(`battery_optimizer_lib/control/`), because upstream 0xAHA/Growatt_ModbusTCP has
no `set_wit_mode`: one fork service call becomes a sequence of VPP register
writes.

**Layering:** `DirectControl` -> `ControlBackend` -> `CommandPlan` -> `Executor`.
The executor seam is what makes writes *structurally* impossible rather than
merely disabled: `DryRunExecutor` performs no I/O, `HaReadOnlyExecutor` performs
real `get_register_data` reads and **refuses** every write step, and
`HaCommissioningExecutor` writes only to a fixed register allowlist
(30100/30407/30408/30409/30476) and refuses everything else *at the executor*,
rather than trusting whichever plan it is handed. `control_mode` in apps.yaml
picks one, and an unrecognised value falls back to `dry_run` — a typo must never
be what grants write access to an inverter.

**`commissioning` mode is not "live" mode.** It can write, so
`backend.dry_run` is False for it — which is exactly why
`automatic_writes_allowed` is a separate question, and the one `DirectControl`
asks before dispatching. In commissioning the optimizer plans and logs every
slot and transmits none of them; the only writes come from
`CommissioningSession` (`control/commissioning.py`), driven one operation at a
time by a person via `scripts/commission.py --confirm`. The operation to run
first is **`session-test`**, which performs HOLD -> a timed renewal experiment
-> RELEASE against one backend, one session and one process, and stays alive
until the release confirms in both halves. **`watchdog-test`** is the second: it
holds for the shortest window, never renews, and polls the control block and the
measured power past the expiry — that is what established there is no expiry.
**`recover`** releases a session a previous instance left armed, on the strength
of the durable lease, and **`strand`** deliberately creates one so that path can
be tested. That grouping is forced by the
design: session ownership is process-local (it comes from this process's own
write results, never from register values), so a one-operation-per-invocation
CLI *cannot* renew or release a session an earlier invocation opened — the
next process would find `30100=1` it did not set and refuse, correctly.
Persisting ownership to disk would mean trusting a file over the hardware.
`hold` and `renew` are therefore **not offered as standalone CLI operations**
at all — an operation that can only open a session the next process cannot
close has no safe use. They remain as library methods because `session_test`
is built from them, alongside release and the 30476 capability probe (which
always restores what it changed). **HOLD and renew are confirmed by reading
30100/30407/30409 back**; a write that did not raise is not an armed session,
and an unverifiable one latches degraded rather than being reported as open.
The duration is validated before any write: 30408=0 is refused and the accepted
range is 1-10 minutes, with the renewal delay required to fall after the 30 s
write cooldown and inside the session it renews.

**There is no hardware watchdog, and 30408 is not one.** `watchdog-test` armed
30408=1, never renewed, and polled every 5 s: 30407 read 1 at t=90s — half again
past the window — and only an explicit release ended the session (2026-09-05).
30408 does not count down either; it echoes the last value written. Treat it as
a duration field whose enforcement is absent on this firmware. Nothing but a
release from the owning process, or a supervised recovery, has been observed to
end a session, so **no duration bounds anything** and every session must be
watched to its release.

**That is what `control/lease.py` exists for.** A durable JSON lease is written
BEFORE authority is taken and removed only once both halves of a release are
confirmed, so a process that dies mid-session leaves evidence. A later run that
finds a lease AND an armed inverter that matches it (same device, 30411 clear,
30409 still holding the recorded setpoint) enters `RECOVERABLE_LEASE`, which
grants exactly one permission: **release**. It never resumes the command, never
re-arms, never promotes to `ACTIVE` — a file cannot say what a register means,
only that a previous instance started something and has no record of finishing
it. Without a lease, `30100=1` stays `AUTHORITY_HELD_NOT_OURS` and is left
alone, unchanged. `--operation strand` (which arms and then `os._exit`s) and
`--operation recover` prove that path against the real failure; both were run
end to end on hardware on 2026-09-05.

A recovering process also adopts the 30100 write timestamp from the lease: the
inverter's 30 s cooldown does not reset because the process that stamped it
died, and without that the release is refused repeatedly before it lands.

**Cleanup after `session_test` obeys three rules.** It always runs (a
`finally`, so a failure, an exception or a Ctrl-C all leave through it); it is
persistent (a release refused because the inverter was momentarily unreadable
schedules no timer, so the cleanup re-initiates rather than waiting on one
that does not exist); and a timeout reports rather than abandons — exceeding
the budget fails the test at CRITICAL but cleanup continues while
`safe_to_stop` is False, since nothing but this process can make it True. Only
an explicit operator force-abort (a second interrupt) stops it, and that says
loudly what may still be armed.
**Run the first three, in that order, before the probe**: they are the minimal VPP path (30408, 30409, 30100,
30407) and none of them touches 30476. Proving 30476 writable licenses nothing
by itself — it is a storage register that changes the inverter's base mode, so
it is spent only where a hypothesis needs it, which is the later grid-charge
experiment. `build_plan` writes 30476=1 for **GRID_CHARGE alone**; HOLD and the
discharges leave the operator's base mode as they found it. Grid charge, both discharges and
max export are unreachable from it three times over: `send()` refuses them,
`build_plan` raises on them, and the executor allowlist refuses the registers
that would implement them. Every operation re-reads and reconciles the inverter
first and refuses — transmitting nothing — when another scheduler's TOU
schedule is loaded (30411 > 0), or the state is hazardous (1/0), externally
owned, release-pending, degraded, or incompletely read (30411 is one of the
registers that must have been read). `release()` is gated by none of it.

**Nothing recovers from a 1/0 found on the inverter, in any mode.**
`reconcile()` warns about the documented discrepancy and stops there — not even
a mode that can write will act on it, because finding two registers in a
combination we did not create is not a licence to change them. The one
automatic recovery that remains is `_enter_arm_failed()`, and the distinction
is the trigger: there we know from our own write results that 30100 landed and
30407 did not, so the half-applied command is ours to undo. A 1/0 discovered on
an inverter we have not written to is not.

**`reconcile()` may not overwrite a session state that asserts our own
authority.** `ACTIVE` and `RELEASE_PENDING` (`OWN_AUTHORITY_STATES`) are set by
this process — after its own successful arm, and by `release()` — so they are
the proof of ownership that distinguishes our session from
`EXTERNAL_CONTROL_PRESENT`. Commissioning reconciles before *every* operation,
including mid-session and mid-release, so a read that clobbered them would
report our own half-released session as somebody else's.

**Four hardware facts the sequences rest on** (upstream `docs/controls/wit-guide.md`):
1. 30100/30407 are written as a pair; 0/0 and 1/1 are the two states this
   project aims for. Upstream documents **1/0 as "VPP standby"** — local
   battery logic suspended, load drawn from the grid — but the reference WIT
   was observed at 1/0 on 2026-09-03 while discharging 3.8 kW and exporting
   2.6 kW with SOC falling. That is an **unresolved discrepancy to warn about,
   not a hazard to recover from**: nothing releases, rolls back or escalates on
   the strength of the register pair alone.
2. Write order is 30408 -> 30409 -> **30407 last**. Arming first applies a stale
   setpoint.
3. Only 30407/30408/30409 are "Not storage" (EEPROM-safe). Everything else is
   written **only on change**.
4. **The base TOU schedule (30411) is never written.** A timed override returns
   to the inverter's own schedule when it expires, so clearing it is not
   required to run a session — and that schedule is not ours. No plan,
   including the release plan, touches 30411.

   Its author is confirmed, not guessed: on 2026-09-03 the reference WIT held
   16 periods with **Growatt Smart Scheduling** enabled; switching Smart
   Scheduling off in the Growatt dashboard zeroed 30411 and all 60 period
   registers (30100 and 30410 went to 0 with them), and they were still zero
   44 h later. `scripts/read_tou_schedule.py --save`/`--diff` is how that was
   established and is the tool for re-checking it.

   That makes **30411 > 0 an interlock**, and the only *positive* evidence of
   a second scheduler this project has: 30100=1 says merely that authority is
   held, but a non-zero period count cannot be ours because no code path here
   writes one. `CommissioningSession._preflight` refuses on it before it
   refuses on 30100 (only the TOU message names what to switch off), and
   `UpstreamVppBackend.send()` refuses every session-holding action under it —
   the backstop that will still be there when automatic control goes live. It
   re-reads 30411 rather than trusting a cached count, and falls back to the
   last known value when the read drops, so an unreadable register cannot lift
   the interlock. **PASSTHROUGH and `release()` are exempt**: an interlock that
   could trap a session open would be worse than the hazard it guards.

`30409 = 0` is *not* idle — it is "suspend forced cycle". **HOLD is +1%**, and
+1% is a literal small charge request rather than a neutral sentinel: measured
on the reference WIT, battery discharge stopped and turned to ~100-150 W of
charge while the house load moved to the grid (~390 W imported), reverting
within seconds of the release. That is the wanted reserve behaviour — the
battery stops serving the house — but it is bought by importing, so anything
reasoning about cost must treat HOLD as a small purchase, not as nothing.
`30474` is a mirror of the last *commanded* setpoint, NOT applied power, so it
can never prove the inverter is doing anything.

- Actions: `grid_charge`, `discharge_to_load`, `discharge_to_grid`, `max_export`, `hold`, `passthrough`
- **30100=1 is not evidence of anything but 30100=1.** It is not proof the
  authority is ours, and equally not proof that something else is actively
  controlling the inverter — this WIT has been seen holding it while running
  its own schedule. `reconcile()` therefore reports
  `AUTHORITY_HELD_NOT_OURS`, which names only what is known. It stays a hard
  interlock (we never arm on top of authority we cannot account for) without
  claiming to know who set it. Ownership comes from `OWN_AUTHORITY_STATES`,
  which are set from our own write results and never inferred from registers.
- Authority is acquired LATE and armed immediately; if arming fails afterwards
  the backend enters `ARM_FAILED_AUTHORITY_HELD` and schedules a rollback —
  it cannot revoke immediately, because its own successful `30100=1` stamped the
  30 s cooldown that now blocks `30100=0`.
- Release is a **lifecycle**, not a call: `ACTIVE -> RELEASE_PENDING ->
  30100=0 read back -> RELEASE_SETTLING -> (settle) -> 30407=0 read back ->
  RELEASED`. **`RELEASED` requires BOTH halves confirmed by read-back**, and
  `read_state() is None` is never one of them — an unreadable inverter means
  "not known to be released", which is the opposite of success, so it stays
  RELEASE_PENDING and retries. `RELEASE_SETTLING` exists because the delayed
  `30407=0` runs on a timer this process owns: authority is already back with
  the inverter, but stopping now strands an arm nobody owns, so
  **`safe_to_stop` is False throughout it** and `reconcile()` may not demote it
  (`UNFINISHED_STATES`). Override *timer expiry* was treated as a third thing
  that must not be conflated with either; on this hardware it does not happen
  at all, so nothing may be assumed to resolve on its own.
- Each command carries power_percent, duration, export_rate, ac_charge_mode, and SOC cutoffs
- AC charge mode auto-selects `pv_priority` vs `ac_priority` based on current PV
  power. This is INTENT only: register 30410 accepts 0 and 1 on the reference
  firmware and rejects 2 with Illegal Function, so 2 is never written.
- Verification is three levels: **ACK** (registers read back as commanded),
  **COMMAND MIRROR** (30474 — diagnostic only, never proof), and **EFFECT**
  (measured power). EFFECT is tri-state: a grid-charge satisfied by PV surplus
  is `INDETERMINATE`, not success and not failure, and only an unambiguous
  `FAIL` escalates.
- **Neither power sign convention may be assumed.** Battery polarity is
  *declared* (`battery_power_direction`: `negative_is_charging` on the
  reference WIT, confirmed against SOC movement) and normalized once in the
  backend, so everything above it sees `positive = charging`. Validation is
  **strict** — an unrecognised value raises at config load rather than falling
  back, because a default that happens to match one inverter is exactly how a
  silently inverted verdict reaches the next one. Grid direction
  comes from the **always-positive** `grid_import_power` / `grid_export_power`
  sensors, never from signed `grid_power`: upstream applies its
  `invert_grid_power` option to the signed sensor but explicitly not to those
  two, so an HA setting could otherwise turn a purchase into a sale inside
  trading verification. Signed grid power is published in diagnostics for
  humans and read by nothing.
- **An ACKed command with no EFFECT releases control; it does not rewrite the
  TOU schedule.** After `effect_failure_limit` (default 2) consecutive `FAIL`
  verdicts **in the same action family** (`effect_family()`: the three discharge
  actions share one, since they are one mechanism differing only in routing),
  `DirectControl` latches degraded, releases the VPP session so the inverter
  resumes its own local logic, and stops commanding until `clear_degraded()`.
  Streaks are per family because a dead grid-charge and a dead discharge are two
  faults; one shared counter would latch after one of each and blame a mechanism
  neither showed to be broken. Missing telemetry is always `INDETERMINATE`,
  never `FAIL` — escalation releases the session, so an unavailable sensor must
  not be able to take the battery off the schedule. The TOU fallback for grid charging is deliberately NOT
  implemented (`TOU_FALLBACK_ENABLED = False`): it would have to overwrite a
  schedule this project neither authored nor can restore.
- **30405 is a VPP-cluster cutoff, not the local floor.** It is used only to
  downgrade an EFFECT `FAIL` to `INDETERMINATE`. The reference inverter was
  observed discharging to 18 % under ordinary Load First operation with
  30405=20, so it does not describe local-mode behaviour. The authoritative
  "do not sell below here" rule is the optimizer's own `min_soc`.
- At startup `reconcile()` never adopts an inherited session: `30100=1 /
  30407=1` before this process armed anything is `AUTHORITY_HELD_NOT_OURS`,
  not `ACTIVE`. That state is a **backend-level hard interlock**:
  `send()` refuses every session-holding action under it, independently of the
  30411 interlock, so automatic control cannot arm on top of inherited
  authority merely because no supervised layer was in the way. `PASSTHROUGH`
  and `release()` stay exempt.
- **`authority_already_held` is an ownership question, not a register value.**
  The acquire write is skipped only for an `ACTIVE` session this process armed
  itself. It used to be skipped whenever `_applied[30100] == 1` — but
  `reconcile()` seeds `_applied` from a register *read*, so any inherited
  `30100=1` silently became a session to build on.
- Duplicate commands within half a slot are skipped; `release_control()` reverts to `passthrough`
- Reliability: each call passes `hass_timeout=config.set_wit_mode_timeout_seconds` (default **15**) and inspects the service response. A raised/`success=False` result is a confirmed failure (ERROR, returns False, last-sent NOT recorded so it retries next slot). A `None` result is an unconfirmed client-side timeout (WARNING, last-sent recorded to avoid schedule spam). The timeout is short *because* the None path is safe: verify-after-set catches a genuinely lost command, whereas a long timeout blocks every other callback of this app.
- Health accounting reads `apply_mode_with_outcome`'s `ApplyOutcome`, never the boolean: `apply_mode` returns True for three outcomes the inverter never acknowledged (`DRY_RUN`, `SKIPPED_DUPLICATE`, `UNCONFIRMED_TIMEOUT`), so only `SENT` resets `_consecutive_apply_failures`, an unconfirmed timeout escalates to the same ERROR after 3 in a row (the hung-modbus case), and a duplicate skip or dry run is neutral.
- Verify-after-set is a **bounded two-step ladder**, max 2 checks and 2 sends per `apply_mode` — never a resend loop:
  1. after `verify_delay_seconds` (default 90) the Inverter Mode sensor (`sensor.growatt_inverter_mode` default, or `inverter_mode_sensor`) is read; a genuine mismatch → WARNING + resend once (bypassing duplicate suppression) + schedule check 2;
  2. after `verify_recheck_seconds` (default 60): match → INFO "recovered after resend"; mismatch → **ERROR** and stop (the next slot retries).

  The re-check exists to separate a lagging HA modbus sensor from an inverter that genuinely drops the override; without it the 30 logged mismatches carried no evidence either way. `DirectControl.get_diagnostics()` exposes the counters (`mismatch_count`, `resend_count`, `resend_recovered_count`, `resend_failed_count`, `persistent_mismatch_count`, `unverifiable_count`) on `sensor.battery_inverter_control_health` and as an attribute of `sensor.battery_optimizer`. A new `apply_mode` supersedes any pending verification timer.
- Dry-run mode: `device_id: ""` in apps.yaml logs commands without sending them

### Battery Cost Tracking
- **Units**: `battery_avg_cost` is landed EUR per stored DC kWh, not raw spot price
- **Weighted average**: `(old_stored_energy * old_landed_cost + added_stored_energy * added_landed_cost) / total_stored_energy`
- **Grid charging**: landed cost includes `(spot + grid_fee) * import_price_multiplier` and AC-to-stored-DC conversion losses
- **PV charging**: landed cost is the foregone net export revenue per stored DC kWh; PV is not booked at the grid purchase price
- **SOC-based tracking**: Measures actual SOC changes, not theoretical charging
- **Discharging**: Reduces stored energy without changing its per-kWh average
- **Persistence**: Stored in `input_number.battery_avg_cost` (survives restarts)
- **Accumulator resync**: `_stored_energy_kwh` is a running total of measured inverter deltas, and it drifts (deltas < 0.05 kWh dropped as noise, midnight counter resets, unmodelled losses). `_resync_stored_energy()` re-anchors it to the SOC-derived value when the battery was empty *before* the event, or as a coarse safety net past a wide drift tolerance (`max(2 kWh, 25% of capacity)`). The depletion case is the one that matters: without it, a charge following a real depletion was averaged against phantom stored energy, so a degenerate 0.0000 basis survived a full depletion (logged 2026-07-28). The drift tolerance is deliberately several charge slots wide — the measured accumulator is the better weighting signal and must not be yanked around by the 1%-granular SOC sensor.
- **A PV cost basis of 0.0000 is correct, not a bug**: PV is booked at foregone net export revenue, and around midday `spot * export_multiplier - export_fee` is genuinely ≤ 0. That is why the schedule log shows the DP's marginal slot value as the primary number and the stored basis as a secondary one.

The tracker is an operational estimate because aggregate inverter counters may not identify every mixed PV/grid contribution. Projected tracking must use the same load and PV predictors as the schedule. The DP itself optimizes forecast cash flows and does not use `battery_avg_cost` as a charge-count constraint or primary objective.

Exact cost formulas, the mode-based source attribution table, slot pricing of energy deltas, and how to interpret the charge log are documented in `docs/scheduling-algorithm.md` § Battery cost tracking.

### Dynamic Configuration
These values read from HA entities at runtime (adjustable without restart):
- `input_number.battery_min_soc` -> min_soc
- `input_number.battery_max_soc` -> max_soc
- `input_number.battery_pv_threshold` -> pv_threshold
- `input_number.battery_avg_cost` -> landed battery-cost persistence
- `input_number.battery_cost_basis_version` -> one-time legacy raw-cost migration marker

### PV forecast bias

**PV shortfall is measured on completed slots, never on a boundary reading.**
`pv_bias_tracker.PvBiasTracker` samples PV power every `pv_sample_seconds` (60s
default) and closes each slot with its *mean* power (= slot energy / slot
hours).  The reactive recalculation requires `pv_reactive_consecutive_slots`
(default 2) consecutive closed slots below `pv_reactive_threshold`, each backed
by at least `pv_reactive_min_samples` readings.  A single instantaneous read
taken at a slot boundary is physically incapable of representing the slot
average (ramps, cloud shadow, sensor latency) and caused 43 recalculations in
33 hours of production logs.

**The streak counts shortfalls since the last recalculation.**
`_check_pv_shortfall` calls `PvBiasTracker.reset_shortfall_streak()` after it
triggers.  `_register_closed` only ever clears the streak on a *good* slot, so
without the reset persistent cloud cover made it grow 2, 3, 4, 5 … and the
`streak < pv_reactive_consecutive_slots` guard could never hold again — every
following slot paid for a full `_recalculate_remaining_schedule` on the same
AppDaemon thread the `_timed_callback` instrumentation warns about. The reset
bounds the cadence at one recalculation per `pv_reactive_consecutive_slots`
slots.

**The bias correction covers the whole remaining horizon, attenuated across day
boundaries.** `get_factor()` returns a clamped
(`pv_bias_min_factor`..`pv_bias_max_factor`) median of `measured / forecast`
over `pv_bias_window_minutes`, relaxing back to 1.0 over `pv_bias_decay_slots`
when observations go stale.  `_predict_pv_kw` multiplies every current/future
slot by it — `_predict_pv_kw_raw` is the un-corrected provider value and MUST be
the one fed back into the tracker, otherwise the bias would feed on itself.
Slots on a *later local day* go through `PvBiasTracker.factor_for_slot`, which
keeps only `pv_bias_next_day_weight ** days` of the deviation from 1.0 and
floors the result at `pv_bias_next_day_min_factor`.  Today's cloud cover is
weather, not a calibration error of tomorrow's forecast: the daily 13:15 run
plans ~33 h ahead, and undamped it scaled all of tomorrow to the 0.2 clamp,
systematically shifting the DP onto paid grid charging.  The `decay_slots`
relaxation cannot substitute for this — it only starts once observations go
stale, which does not happen within a day.  The forecast snapshot per slot is
written once (`ensure_slot_forecast`, first write wins) because
`PvForecastService.refresh_for_shortfall` caps the cached current slot at the
observed production, which would otherwise make the ratio read ~1.0.

### Runtime constraints

**This app needs more than one AppDaemon thread.** `set_wit_mode` is a
synchronous, blocking service call made from a callback, so on the default
single thread one slow inverter write stalls schedule execution, the SOC
listener and PV sampling alike (production: 70 × "Excessive time spent in
callback (limit=10.0s)" at 10–34 s, all on `thread-0`). Set
`appdaemon: total_threads: 4` in `appdaemon.yaml` (or pin the app). The app
instruments its own callbacks via the `_timed_callback` decorator and
`_record_callback_duration()`, warning above `callback_warn_seconds` and
repeating the `total_threads` advice once after three overruns. The decorator
must keep `functools.wraps` + `*args/**kwargs`: AppDaemon calls these
positionally (`execute_scheduled_mode(kwargs, force=True)`) and the orchestrator
is not unit-tested.

Asynchronous I/O is explicitly out of scope — the mitigation is a shorter
timeout plus more threads, not a rewrite.

### Scheduled Tasks
- **13:15 daily**: Full optimization (after Nord Pool prices publish)
- **Startup**: Initial optimization
- **Every `pv_sample_seconds` (60s)**: PV power sampling + slot close + bias refresh
- **Every 15 min**: Adaptive re-evaluation + schedule change logging
- **Every 5 min**: Safety checks
- **Hourly**: Mode execution + battery cost update

## Deployment to the HA machine

The running app lives on the Home Assistant share, not in this repo:

```
//192.168.33.167/addon_configs/a0d7b954_appdaemon/apps/
├── apps.yaml              # LIVE config, contains the HA token — never overwrite from here
├── battery_optimizer.py
└── battery_optimizer_lib/
```

**STOP the AppDaemon add-on before copying more than one file.** AppDaemon
hot-reloads on every `.py` modification, so a multi-file copy is imported
*while it is still in progress*: it will load a new module against its old
peers. That is not hypothetical — on 2026-07-28 it produced

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'battery_optimizer_lib.soc_projection'
TypeError: record_discharging() got an unexpected keyword argument 'battery_temp_start'
```

from a tree whose files were all individually correct. Copying a *single*
file while running is safe (one reload, no window).

Procedure:

1. Back up `battery_optimizer.py` + `battery_optimizer_lib/` on the share.
2. Stop the add-on.
3. Copy both, then delete `__pycache__` in each directory.
4. Verify every deployed file matches the repo, then start the add-on.

Before deploying, smoke-test the new code against the LIVE `apps.yaml`
(`BatteryOptimizerConfig.from_args`) and import every module — the unit suite
does not cover the orchestrator, so a config or wiring break only shows up here.

`scripts/deploy.ps1` automates exactly that procedure (Windows PowerShell 5.1):
git-clean check plus the commit/branch it will deploy, `pytest`, `py_compile`,
`scripts/smoke_config.py` against a temp copy of the LIVE `apps.yaml` (deleted
immediately — the share's `apps.yaml` is only ever read), a timestamped
`backup-<ts>/` on the share keeping the 5 newest, stop → copy (pruning `.py`
files the repo no longer has) → `__pycache__` cleanup → SHA256 verification →
start. Start with `-DryRun`, which runs every check and prints the planned copy
list while writing nothing; `-Restore <backup-dir>` rolls a deploy back through
the same stop/copy/start dance. Add-on stop/start goes through HA's Supervisor
proxy when `-HaToken` is given, otherwise the script pauses for you to do it in
the UI. See `scripts/README.md`.

## Development

This is a Python AppDaemon project. Use `uv` for running Python scripts and syntax checks. No formatter or linter is enforced.

**Shell note**: Even though the platform is Windows, the shell is bash. Don't use Windows-specific syntax like `cd /d`. The working directory is already set, so run commands directly without `cd`.

```bash
# Check syntax
uv run python -m py_compile appdaemon/apps/battery_optimizer.py

# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run a single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_algorithm.py -v

# Run a single test function
uv run pytest tests/test_algorithm.py::TestFindOptimalSchedule::test_basic_charge_discharge_pattern -v

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=appdaemon/apps --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Testing Architecture
- `conftest.py` mocks the entire `appdaemon.plugins.hass.hassapi` module before any imports, so library modules can be tested without AppDaemon installed.
- Library modules in `battery_optimizer_lib/` are tested directly. The main `battery_optimizer.py` (AppDaemon orchestrator) is not unit-tested — it's validated via dry-run mode (`device_id: ""` in apps.yaml).
- `apps.yaml` contains a long-lived HA access token — do not commit changes to it carelessly.

## Key Dependencies
- AppDaemon 4, Home Assistant, Nord Pool integration, Growatt Modbus integration
